## Ethical Keylogger Demo (Python)

This project is a **basic keylogger tool** built for educational and cybersecurity demonstration purposes.
 It captures keyboard input, logs it with timestamps, encrypts the data, and saves it to a file â€” all within a transparent, consent-based framework.
**Disclaimer**: This tool is intended for ethical use only. Do not run it on any system without explicit permission. It is designed for learning, debugging, and controlled demonstrations.


## Features
- Logs all keystrokes (including special keys)
- Adds timestamps to each entry
- Encrypts log data using simple XOR encryption
- Stops automatically when `Esc` is pressed
- Consent prompt before logging begins
- Saves logs to `encrypted_keylog.txt`


## Purpose
This tool simulates how input tracking works in a safe, ethical environment.
 Great for demos, awareness, and cybersecurity training.
